		'''
		Class RTPHeader
		@parameter  Version: (2 bits) Indicates the version of the protocol. Current version is 2.
		@parameter  P (Padding): (1 bit) Used to indicate if there are extra padding bytes at the end of the RTP packet. 
		@parameter  X (Extension): (1 bit) Indicates presence of an Extension header between standard header and payload data. This is application or profile specific. 
		@parameter  CC (CSRC count): (4 bits) Contains the number of CSRC identifiers (defined below) that follow the fixed header.
		@parameter  M (Marker): (1 bit) Used at the application level and defined by a profile. If it is set, it means that the current data has some special relevance for the application.
		@parameter  PT (Payload type): (7 bits) Indicates the format of the payload and determines its interpretation by the application.
		@parameter  SeqNumber: (16 bits) The sequence number is incremented by one for each RTP data packet sent and is to be used by the receiver to detect packet loss and to restore packet sequence. 
        @parameter  TimeStamp: (32 bits) Used by the receiver to play back the received samples at appropriate time and interval. 
        @parameter  SSRC: (32 bits) Synchronization source identifier uniquely identifies the source of a stream. 
        @parameter  CSRC: (32 bits each, number indicated by CSRC count field) Contributing source IDs enumerate contributing sources to a stream which has been generated from multiple sources.
        @parameter  HeaderExtension: (4*CC bits) The first 32-bit word contains a profile-specific identifier (16 bits) and a length specifier (16 bits) that indicates the length of the extension (EHL = extension header length) in 32-bit units, excluding the 32 bits of the extension header.
